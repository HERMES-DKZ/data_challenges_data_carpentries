    "To develop a deep understanding of what Git is and how it works, it would be helpful to use your powers of imagination. Imagine your partner and you get to raise a child. Let us name this child Lily. As soon as Lily enters your lives, each one of you develops their own plans and wishes for her future: you want Lily to become an internationally known sports athlete, whereas your partner wants her to grow up to become a prominent scientist. Since you both want the best for Lily's future, but each have your own methods of raising and educating her, you realize you cannot have her go both life paths at once. This is when the wizard üßôüèª of Git comes to assist you by inviting you to an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wizard of Git makes you an offer: he keeps the real infant Lily by himself and gives you and your partner each a cloned Lily instead. He also hands each one of you a magical polaroid camera and a photo album. From here on, each one of you enters an alternative reality, taking their cloned Lily, their camera and album with them. Each parent raises their cloned Lily in their own alternative reality exactly the way they want to, and documents important moments of her life using the camera. For example, the first photo in your album would be one of your cloned Lily at the age of 3 with a swimsuit, standing near a swimming pool. You put this photo in the album and write a note next to it: \"Lily at the age of 3, just after having taken her first swimming lesson.\" You and your partner each keep raising their cloned Lily up to the age of 18 and each of you documents the key moments of her growth in their own alternative world, using the magical camera and the album. As soon as Lily turns 18 in each alternative reality, the magic ends: your cloned Lilies disappear and you and your partner both return to the real world, only carrying your photo albums with you. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, nothing has changed since you entered the two alternative realities. Lily is still an infant and now you want her to grow up to the age of 18 at the blink of an eye, going through every single stage that both you and your partner have documented with your cameras. The wizard of Git is here to help you do that. He looks at the photos and sees if it is possible to merge both parallel realities with each other and have Lily go through every single life stage that was documented on both sides. Sometimes it is possible to merge these realities. For example, Lily has lived in Johannesburg in your alternative reality at the age of 10, going to school and taking swim lessons in her free time. You have a photo in your album that shows her during practice, with a note that delivers exactly this information. In your partner's alternative reality, Lily has also lived in Johannesburg and gone to the same school at the age of 10, but she has spent her spare time focusing more deeply on her mathematics lessons. Your partner's photo of the ten-year-old Lily depicts her smiling proudly in the camera, holding the solution of a maths problem in her hand. These two events in the lives of the two cloned Lilies can be merged, so that the real Lily can have gone to school in Johannesburg at the age of 10 and divided her spare time between solving mathematics problems and excelling in swimming. \n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes conflicts between the two alternative realities can make the merging process difficult. If your cloned Lily has been in Brazil at the age of 17 taking full-time professional swimming training, whereas your partner's cloned Lily has lived in South Korea at that age while she was taking full-time professional math courses, then it is not clear what the real Lily's life experience should be. Here, you and your partner should engage in conversation and each manipulate your alternative realities in a way so that they can be merged into the *real* reality by the Git wizard. Going through the entire albums, solving the conflicts and merging the two alternative realities up until Lily's 18th birthday can finally result in a real Lily who is now suddenly grown from infancy to being 18 years old and who has a memory of the merged life experiences resulting from both alternative realities. \n",
    "\n",
    "This imaginary anecdote can clearly explain how Git works. Just replace Lily with any project that you are developing collaboratively with a team, the photos and their notes with *commits*, the alternative realities with the *branches* and the final merging of the two realities with the *pull and merge request*. The real Lily stands for the final product of your project. \n",

    "Usually, the projects that you start developing are composed of files, stored in folders on your personal computer. But remember! In the world of Git, objects and the relationships between them have different names than in the worlds of common operating systems such as Windows or macOS. When you project the magical world of Git on the folder structure that you have already created locally on your computer, the main folder containing your files is not called a *folder* any more, but rather a *repository* in the world of Git.

This means: as long as you keep working in the main folder of your project and the main Git repository, your local files and folders are the same as the ones in the Git repository and Git only registers their changes at your demand. The real magic of Git begins when you create *brances*, or virual realities, from the main repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine you are going to test some alternatives on the project that you are working on, but you are not sure if these alternative will turn out the way you have imagined. For example, suppose you are a graphic designer and you are designing a logo for a client. You have already come up with a draft of the logo and saved it to the file \"logo.jpg\", and would like to test if would look nicer if you rounded the edges and changed the yellow colors to orange. One way of doing so would be to create a copy of your draft file, rename it to, say, \"logo_round_edges_and_orange.jpg\", and keep working on it. But, as it was mentioned in earlier episode, this could soon lead to a chaos where you will have multiple files with similar names on your computer and you could quickly lose an overview of what is what and which alternative designs are in which file. Here is how the wizard of Git can help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of Git, it is possible to create alternative realities. If the reality consists of the concrete files and folders that you have stored on your hard drive, Git allows you to create alternative versions of these files and folders without changing the actual files and folders. This is the most important part of the magic of Git! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember!** <font color=blue> Whereas the folder- and file systems on your computer follow a spacial logic (eg. you look for the *path* of a file and a certain file is *inside* a certain folder), the logic of Git is of a temporal nature, meaning that Git can create *simultaneous* parallel realities in which different adjustments are made to the files that are stored on your computer. Also, Git can record different *stages* of the development of certain files and folders. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create these alternative realities, using *branching*. The wizard of Git imagines the temporal aspect of your project as a tree. As long as you are working on the main repository and saving the changes directly to its files and folders, you are on the *trunk* of the tree, or on its *main branch*. When you decide to create an alternative reality as a graphic designer and test your new idea in it, you should create a new *branch* stemming from the *main branch* and work in there. When you create a new branch, you should first give it a name. In the example of the graphic designer, this name could be \"round_edges_and_orange\". When you enter this branch, you sill see your files and folders as they were on your hard drive before you created the branch. So here, you will keep working on the file \"logo.jpg\", make your desired changes to it, and save them. But if you exit the round_edges_and_orange branch, return to the main branch, and open the same file \"logo.jpg\", you would see that it is still in the state that it was before you created the new branch and applied changes to it. Remember the example of Lily and the wizard of Git? Lily, or the \"logo.jpg\" file on the main branch, remains unchanged, whereas you keep changing and developing it further in a virtual reality. Just as in the main branch, it is also possible to *add* your file in the new branch to Git's stage and write a *commit* on it at each desired and meaningful stage of development, just as it was possible to document Lily's growth with the magical camera and add it to an album with a short note.

    "When you are finished with your adjustments, it is time to compare the resulting design in the \"round_edges_and_orange\" branch with the ones in the *main branch*. If you do not like the alternative design, you can simple delete the branch that you created this design in it and keep working in the main branch again, making the final adjustments to the logo. But if you *do* prefer the alternative design, you should *merge* it with the design that you already have on the *main* branch. Because, remember, the only *real* reality in the world of Git consists of files and folders that you have saved onto your hard drive. If you copy these files and folders onto a USB-stick or email them to somebody, they will be transfered in the stage that they are in within the main branch. In other words, the other branches created out the main branch do not convert into reality until they are *merged* with the reality. Before the merging, they are only *alternative* realities that exist in a magical world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in Lily's example, conflicts may occur while trying to merge different branches with the main branch. In Lily's example, the conflict occurred because somebody else had also created their own branch, i.e. their own virtual reality, and had developed it differently from you. Conflicts such as these occur while collaborating with other people, using a remote repository hosting service such as Github. For now, we should handle merge conflict management between a new branch and the main branch, which is also likely to occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which kind of file you are working on, resolving merge conflicts can be different. In case of image files, since it is very difficult to create a synthesis of the two images in the two branches, you should often choose between the two images. If you opt for the new logo that you have developed in the \"round_edges_and_orange\" branch while merging this branch with the main branch, this logo will replace the one you originally had on your hard drive, with sharp edges and the dominant color yellow. After merging the new branch with the main branch, you can delete the new branch, because you do not need the alternative reality that you had created in it any more. Alternatively, if you prefer your original logo design for now, but would like to keep the alternative one as well and maybe return to it later, you can still keep the branch containing the alternative logo, but keep working further on the one that you previously had on the main branch, without merging the two branches. \n",

To make collaboration easier and the steps in the process more understandable, it is always recommended not to work on the main repo, but rather to create branches and work on them.

This way, you see both versions of both chapters on Github and you tell Github to replace the existing chapter 1 in the main branch with your version of chapter 1 and replace the existing chapter 2 in the main branch with your collaborator's version of chapter 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question you may ask here is: who is going to resolve such conflicts while merging different branches with the main? In a big project, it can cause a lot of troubles if every collaborator in the project merges different branches with the main and makes important decisions on how to resolve the conflicts. It is best practice to have only one person make such decisions. This person may be the project manager or the owner of the main repo on Github. If you are the owner of the main repo on Github, your collaborator does not directly merge their branch with the main branch, but they rather create a *pull request* on Github. This means that instead of actively *pushing* their branch to the main, they ask you to *pull* this branch into the main branch. Then, you will be notified of the pull request by Github and check on Github if there are conflicts between your collaborator's branch and the main branch. You then make decisions about how to solve the conflicts and accept or deny the pull request. Of course, it is always best to resolve the conflict in conversation with your collaborator, so that everybody understand how and based on what information the conflicts were resolved. \n",
    "\n",
    "When working on larger projects, the processes of creating new branches, developing them locally, pushing them to the remote branch on Github and finally creating pull requests to merge these branches with the main branch take place multiple times. Therefore, the first thing that you do when you start your working day should be to pull everything from the Github repo onto your local repo to update the state of the project files and work from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** This pulling (from the Github repo to your local repo) is different from the pull request on Github, during which you ask the repo owner or project manager to pull your branch into the main branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you the logic behind Git and Github and the best practice of using them locally and remotely, it is time to actually get your hands dirty and start using Git. "
